The files for each exercise are:
Exercise 1 - E1.m
Exercise 2 - E2.m
Exercise 3 - E3.m

The files were created in app designer and exported as 'filename.m' files. The app files (Exercise1.mlapp, Exercise2.mlapp and Exercise3.mlapp) were also included. 

For E3.m to work it needs to be on the same folder as dblp.mat
